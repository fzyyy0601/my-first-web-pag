            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Kard (Korean: 카드, stylized K.A.R.D or KARD) 
                is a South Korean co-ed group formed by DSP Media. 
                They are composed of members J.Seph, BM, Somin, and Jiwoo.
                 They officially debuted on July 19, 2017, with their extended play Hola Hola.
            </p>

            <p>Mixed-gender groups are considered a rarity in the Korean music industry, 
                with several co-ed acts like Play The Siren, Sunny Hill, and Co-Ed being regarded
                 as unsuccessful. With Kard's debut, Forbes noted that the group was "headed for
                  worldwide success" after quickly building an international presence through their
                   North and South American tour in their pre-debut, which was further expanded 
                   following the release of Hola Hola. Billboard magazine has described Kard to be
                    "one of the most successful co-ed K-pop acts to ever exist" which was seen when their 
                    debut EP landed at number 3 on the World Albums Chart.</p>
            <p>While Kard has risen to international success especially in South America, they have been
                 criticized for focusing primarily on the international music market. Due to their lack of promotions
                  in their country of origin, a Korean broadcasting station official once told the members of Kard 
                  that they were "like a fictional group [to him]". However, the group has stated that they are 
                  aiming for further activities in South Korea</p>
